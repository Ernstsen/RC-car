# RC-car

Repository for code used in creating a remote-controlled car. The car is controlled through a python interface, on a
laptop on the same network as the car

# Devices

The project consists of multiple devices, working together. This section will describe the devices and the connection.
The devices are

- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
  with [camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/). This will host the interface to the car, and
  supply a video feed from its front.
- [Propeller Activity Board WX](https://www.parallax.com/product/propeller-activity-board-wx/). This octa-core
  microprocessor will be the heart of the car. It will control the DC-motor, lights etc.
