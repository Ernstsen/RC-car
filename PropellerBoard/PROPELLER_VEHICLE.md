# Propeller Vehicle

This part of the project contains the code for the vehicle, which is executed on
a [Propeller Activity Board WX](https://www.parallax.com/product/propeller-activity-board-wx/).

The code is developed using
the [SimpleIDE](https://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/language/propeller-c/propeller-c-set-simpleide), which is also used
in deploying the software to the developer board.
